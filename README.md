# Machine-Learning-Model-Home-Price-Prediction

This repository contains a home price prediction model built using three different regression algorithms: Decision Tree Regressor, Lasso Regression, and Linear Regression. <br />
Predicting the price of a home is a common problem in the real estate industry and can be crucial for both buyers and sellers. 

This project aims to provide a solution to this problem by implementing three different regression models:

- **Decision Tree Regresso**r: A machine learning model that uses a decision tree to make predictions.  
- **Lasso Regression**: A linear regression model that incorporates L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and feature selection.  
- **Linear Regression**: A traditional linear regression model used for predicting home prices.
